## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the Llama 3B language model for custom NLP tasks. All workflows, experiments, and results are documented using Jupyter Notebooks for clarity and reproducibility.

## Features

- Step-by-step Jupyter Notebooks for fine-tuning Llama 3B
- Code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- Easy-to-follow documentation for running and customizing experiments
- Modular structure to support new datasets or tasks

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/21J41A0449/FineTuningLlama3B.git
   cd FineTuningLlama3B
   ```

2. **Set up a Python environment:**
   It is recommended to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for creating isolated environments.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Most dependencies are listed in the notebooks. Typical requirements include:
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - torch
   - transformers
   - datasets
   - jupyter

   You can install the main dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas torch transformers datasets jupyter
   ```

## Usage

- Launch Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Open the relevant notebook and follow the instructions to fine-tune and evaluate the Llama 3B model.

## Project Structure

- All code and documentation are contained in Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files.
- Supporting files (datasets, configs, results, etc.) may be included in subdirectories.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find bugs, have suggestions, or want to add features, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
