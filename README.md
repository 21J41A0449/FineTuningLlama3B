# FineTuningLlama3B

Welcome to FineTuningLlama3B — a Colab-first project demonstrating how to fine-tune the Llama 3B language model for custom NLP tasks. The repository contains Google Colab notebooks with step‑by‑step code for data preparation, training/finetuning, evaluation, and inference.

## Overview
This project shows how to fine-tune Llama 3B on custom datasets using Google Colab to provide an accessible, reproducible environment with optional GPU/TPU acceleration. Notebooks are authored to be runnable from Colab with minimal setup and include checkpoints, evaluation scripts, and inference examples.

## Key Features
- Colab-first notebooks with runnable cells for each step (preprocess → finetune → evaluate → infer).
- Example dataset preprocessing and tokenization pipelines.
- Support for training with Hugging Face Transformers / Accelerate or other compatible tooling.
- Guidance for saving and loading model checkpoints to Google Drive or Hugging Face Hub.

## Open in Colab
To run a notebook in Colab, open the notebook on GitHub and click "Open in Colab" or use the pattern:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/21J41A0449/FineTuningLlama3B/blob/main/<notebook>.ipynb

(Replace `<notebook>.ipynb` with the notebook filename in this repo.)

## Colab Usage

### Runtime & Hardware
- Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator → GPU (recommended) or TPU when supported.
- For Llama 3B, prefer GPU with >12GB VRAM or use Colab Pro/Pro+ for larger memory. Consider model sharding, 8-bit/4-bit quantization, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) to fit GPUs with limited VRAM.

### Typical Setup Cells
Run the top cells in each notebook to install packages and authenticate:
```python
# Example install cell
!pip install -q transformers accelerate bitsandbytes peft datasets safetensors
# (adjust packages per notebook instructions)
```

### Mounting Drive & Persisting Artifacts
Persist checkpoints or large datasets:
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/FineTuningLlama3B
```
Save/restore model checkpoints in Drive or push to Hugging Face Hub to avoid losing progress when sessions end.

## Dependencies
Common packages used in the notebooks (versions may vary by notebook):
- python >= 3.8
- transformers
- accelerate
- datasets
- peft (for LoRA)
- bitsandbytes (optional for quantized training)
- safetensors
- sentencepiece / tokenizers (if required)

Install in Colab with:
```bash
!pip install transformers accelerate datasets peft bitsandbytes safetensors
```

## Configuration
- API tokens: If using Hugging Face Hub or other hosted services, set tokens in environment variables or use Colab secrets:
```python
import os
os.environ['HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN'] = "hf_xxx"
```
- Training settings (batch size, learning rate, gradient accumulation, precision) are exposed as notebook variables — tune them for your runtime.

## Data & Models
- Use your own dataset in supported formats (JSONL, CSV, text) or public datasets from Hugging Face Datasets.
- Recommended approaches for large models:
  - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA).
  - 8-bit/4-bit inference or training with bitsandbytes.
  - Gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes.
- Provide tokenization and data chunking examples in the notebooks.

## Best Practices & Safety
- Fine-tuning on domain-specific or sensitive data requires careful evaluation and governance.
- This repository is for research/experimentation only — not for clinical, legal, or safety-critical production use without rigorous validation.
- Do not upload private or regulated data to public services without compliance checks (HIPAA/GDPR).

## Project Structure
- *.ipynb — Google Colab notebooks (main workflow, preprocessing, training, evaluation, inference).
- /data (optional) — example datasets or instructions (not always committed directly due to size).
- /checkpoints (optional instructions) — recommended locations for saving model checkpoints (Drive/Hugging Face Hub).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome:
1. Open an issue to discuss changes or report bugs.
2. Submit a pull request with notebook improvements, reproducible examples, or updated dependency pins.
3. When adding notebooks, include a short README cell explaining required runtime and any large-file dependencies.
